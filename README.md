NAME
====

**CSV::Tools** - Provides Raku programs and routines to manage CSV tables.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use CSV::Tools;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**CSV::Tools** provides the following program:

With a CSV file name entry, the following files are created with names based on the input file name without the '.csv' suffix:

    ./lib/My.rakumod
    $HOME/.raku/bin/manage-my

For customized names, use a YAML configuration file with the following format:

    csv: </path/to/source csv file>
    lib: </path/to/some.rakumod>
    bin: <desired management file name> # this file will be placed
                                        # in the user's $HOME/.raku/bin
                                        # directory
