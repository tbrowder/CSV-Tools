NAME
====

**CSV::Tools** - Provides Raku programs and routines to manage CSV tables.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use CSV::Tools;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**CSV::Tools** provides the following program:

    csv: </path/to/source csv file>
    lib: </path/to/some.rakumod>
    bin: <desired management file name> # this file will be placed
                                        # in the user's $HOME/.raku/bin
                                        # directory
