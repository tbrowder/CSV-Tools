are created with names based on the input

For customized names, use a YAML configuration
file with the following format:

=begin code
csv: </path/to/source csv file>
lib: </path/to/some.rakumod>
bin: <desired management file name> # this file will be placed
                                    # in the user's $HOME/.raku/bin
                                    # directory
=end code
